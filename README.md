# Uni-Timetable-Manager
Our project implements a website application that allows students to manage their timetables, view them, and make changes accordingly. Students can create accounts, log in and use all the available resources and store that data is a database.

Students are greeted by a decorative homepage with buttons that lead them to the user registration and login

Some functionalities include:
1. User authenticaion
2. Classroom filtering
3. Detection of time slot conflicts
4. Saving to local storage
